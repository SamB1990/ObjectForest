# ObjectFroest
An Academic style project, the object forset is a runtime sytle object class builder/handler allowing you to build Trees(classes) with leaves(Properties) and also branches(inheriting class) which also contain leaves(more properties) and this is repeated as far down as you wish to go. Each tree has a current point(class) at which you are within the tree ad this is the class that you can inspect.

I have used it within my Console.Command project to allow you to step up & down a chain of command levels(Braches) each level can contain miltiple classes(Leaves) it then searches these classes for actions and executes the action.
